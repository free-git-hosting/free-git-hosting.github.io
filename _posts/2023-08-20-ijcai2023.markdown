## Overview

Multimodal Reasoning is an emerging research area that aims to enable intelligent systems to reason and learn from information obtained from various modalities, such as language, images, videos, and sensor data. This symposium focuses on exploring different aspects of multimodal reasoning, including combining multimodal learners, language models, and attention mechanisms, evaluating the effectiveness of transfer learning and pre-training in multimodal reasoning, and examining the impact of data augmentation techniques. Additionally, we will explore how multimodal reasoning can be used to improve educational outcomes, healthcare outcomes, and other information processing tasks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a new computing paradigm in the field of healthcare, and the significant progress achieved in the application of artificial intelligence is due to the analysis and mining of massive, high-quality, and multi-center data resources. However, the contradiction between data privacy and shared use has become a major bottleneck in the development of intelligent healthcare. Federated learning adopts the idea of "data immobility and model mobility" to achieve the integration analysis and collaborative modeling of multi-center data under the conditions of "original data not leaving the domain and data availability but invisibility". This report will start from the challenges faced by multi-center collaboration healthcare, and introduce the basic principles, cutting-edge progress, as well as federated learning-based healthcare research platform and applications.

### Multimodal Measurement Framework

> <cite>Quanying Liu</cite>

{% highlight html %}
Abstract: During the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), their abilities have grown significantly, leading to increased awareness of the world and themselves. Have LLMs acquired feelings, emotions, self-awareness, and free will? Would they contemplate suicide? Do they have an intention to lie to humans, or even to destroy humanity? As many LLMs have been trained, will they suffer from different mental diseases like humans? These concerns go beyond the scope of computer science, posing new challenges for the LLM community which require comprehensive evaluations of the intelligence and treatments of mental health for LLMs.
