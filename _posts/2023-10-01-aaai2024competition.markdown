## Background

Mathematics has always been regarded as the touchstone of artificial intelligence. The ability to reason mathematically represents, to a certain extent, the level of intelligence of today's general artificial intelligence cognitive models. When large language models (LLMs) overcome their "innate defects" (such as lack of complex reasoning capabilities, inaccurate numerical calculations, etc.) and successfully cope with the challenges of mathematical reasoning, the world of artificial intelligence will enter a new era.

In this context, how to enhance the mathematical reasoning ability of LLMs and break through the innate deficiencies of language models has become a focus of attention in the global artificial intelligence field. Therefore, we have decided to hold the AAAI2024 Global Competition on Mathematical Problem Solving and Reasoning, inviting AI enthusiasts, experts, and developers from around the world with forward-looking perspectives and innovative spirits to explore and solve challenges in the field of mathematics using LLMs. Specifically, in this competition, we would like to ask participants to **automatically solve K-12 math problems by using LLMs**.

This competition will bring us a brand new experience, allowing us to enjoy the fun of mathematics while appreciating the powerful capabilities of artificial intelligence. Let us witness together how AI solves challenging problems in new ways and paves new paths for the future.

## Data & Task Description

In this competition, to fully explore the mathematical reasoning abilities of various large models, we have divided the competition into two tracks: 


- Track 1: Chinese Math Problem Solving 

- Track 2: English Math Problem Solving


The math problem datasets used in both tracks are collect from K-12 math related competitions, including the "Ying Chun Cup", "Hope Cup" Mathematics Competition in China and the American Mathematics Competitions (AMC 8/10/12) worldwide. Both the datasets for track 1 (TAL-SAQ7K-CN dataset) and track 2 (TAL-SAQ6K-EN) are provided by TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL), which is a leading smart learning solutions provider in China with global footprints.

These problem contents are authentic and reliable, and their formats have been carefully processed. Each problem includes the problem statement, difficulty level, and a chain of knowledge concepts/points from coarse-grained to fine-grained that are related to the problem. Moreover, the mathematical expressions in both datasets have been processed into the standard Latex format.

Specifically, the TAL-SAQ7K-CN dataset covers mathematical knowledge from elementary school, middle school, and high school levels, while the TAL-SAQ6K-EN dataset only includes mathematical knowledge from the elementary school level.

### Evaluation Task

The TAL-SAQ7K-CN and TAL-SAQ6K-EN datasets are used as the test sets for this competition. They consist of 7,436 and 5,927 questions respectively. Answers to the questions will not be disclosed.

The prediction task is using LLMs to generate the intermediate reasoning steps and the final answer for math problems. When submitting the results, the participants are asked to **submit all the predicted results of all the math problems in either track 1 or track 2**. We will compare the model's predicted answers with the ground truth answers and use accuracy to determine the ranking in the competition. **Accuracy is the sole evaluation metric for ranking in this competition**.


### Leaderboards

In this competition, we create both public and private leaderboards for better participation experience:

- **public leaderboard**: The team ranking in public leaderboard are measured in terms of accuracy  on a pre-fixed 30% of data samples in TAL-SAQ7K-CN or TAL-SAQ6K-EN. The purpose of this public leaderboard is to help participants debug and fine-tune their LLMs results.


- **private leaderboard**: The competition awards are **only based on the team ranking in private leaderboard**. We will use the remaining 70% data samples in TAL-SAQ7K-CN or TAL-SAQ6K-EN for evaluation. The highest score of the participants on the private leaderboard will be the final result of the competition.

### Data Files

Both the TAL-SAQ7K-CN and TAL-SAQ6K-EN datasets can be download at [https://github.com/math-eval/aaai2024comp](https://github.com/math-eval/aaai2024comp).

Each question and its auxiliary information is stored in the JSON format with the following fields:

- "dataset_version": The identifier of the source dataset version.
- "queId": The identifier of the global ID for the question.
- "difficulty": The difficulty level of the question, ranging from 0 to 4.
- "qtype": The type of the question, with the value "short_answer" indicating that the question is a short answer question.
- "problem": The question content of a math competition question.
- "knowledge_point_routes": The knowledge point route from coarse-grained to fine-grained.  

Here, we provide a real sample from TAL-SAQ6K-EN and TAL-SAQ7K-CN respectively.
