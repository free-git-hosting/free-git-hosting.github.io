## Keynote Talk Details
> ### Responsible AI for Leverage Points in Digital Assessment
>
> <cite>Jill Burstein</cite>

{% highlight html %}
Abstract: As AI-driven educational technologies continue to expand, so do the complexities of digital assessment systems. This keynote explores how a structured ecosystem approach can help identify key leverage points—design, measurement, security, and responsible AI—ensuring validity, fairness, and equity in assessments. By integrating human-centered, responsible AI practices, we can mitigate risks, for instance, to improve test-taker experiences, and uphold rigorous standards in automated scoring, content generation, and security protocols. With global responsible AI guidelines on the rise, this talk will provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners to embed ethical AI practices into digital assessment frameworks, shaping the future of AI in education.

Bio: Dr. Jill Burstein is a Principal Assessment Scientist at Duolingo, where she leads validity and efficacy research for the Duolingo English Test (DET). She is a co-founder of SIG EDU, a Special Interest Group on Building Educational Applications under the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). Her research focuses on artificial intelligence and natural language processing, educational measurement, equity in education, learning analytics, and linguistics. Dr. Burstein pioneered the first automated writing evaluation system used in large-scale, high-stakes assessments, laying the foundation for AI-driven writing assessment. Her recent work explores responsible AI and the validation of digital language assessments. She has published extensively in top academic conferences and journals in the fields of computational linguistics, education, and assessment.

> ### Generative AI in Education: Enhancing Learning, Feedback, and Research with LLMs
>
> <cite>Maciej Pankiewicz</cite>

{% highlight html %}
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence is transforming education by improving instruction, automating feedback, and supporting research. This presentation draws on practical experience with Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational settings, from virtual teaching assistants that engage with students on discussion forums to automated assessment tools that provide instant feedback on programming assignments. Beyond instruction, we will examine how LLMs can support qualitative research through automated coding and enhance privacy compliance by de-identifying forum posts. By analyzing the impact of these applications, we will explore both the opportunities and challenges of integrating LLMs into education.

Bio: Dr. Maciej Pankiewicz is a Senior Research Investigator and Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education (Penn GSE). He also serves as a researcher at the Penn Center for Learning Analytics. Dr. Pankiewicz earned his Ph.D. in Engineering from the University of Bonn in 2011 and his M.Sc. in Computer Science and Econometrics from the Warsaw University of Life Sciences in 2006. His research interests include educational data mining, learning analytics, and learning engineering. Dr. Pankiewicz leads the development of JeepyTA, an AI-driven virtual teaching assistant powered by large language models, aimed at enhancing educational experiences for both students and instructors. Dr. Pankiewicz has published extensively in top journals and conferences. His research has been recognized with multiple nominations for best paper awards at international conferences, including ICQE 2024 and ICCE 2023.

# Introduction

## Motivation

The rapid advancement of generative AI technologies presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges within the educational landscape. With tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and other generative models becoming increasingly sophisticated, educators have access to powerful resources that can enhance learning experiences, personalize education, and streamline administrative tasks. However, these advancements also bring forth critical issues such as ethical considerations, data privacy concerns, and potential biases. This workshop aims to explore how generative AI can be effectively and responsibly integrated into education, ensuring that its benefits are maximized while mitigating associated risks. 

## Challenges

* **Ethical Considerations**: Ensuring that generative AI is used ethically in educational settings, addressing issues related to bias, fairness, and transparency. Addressing inherent biases in AI algorithms that could lead to unequal learning opportunities or reinforce existing disparities.
* **Data Privacy**: Protecting student data and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations when using AI tools.
* **Integration and Adoption**: Overcoming barriers to integrating AI tools into traditional educational systems, including resistance from educators and lack of technical infrastructure.
* **Skill Gaps**: Equipping educators with the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively use AI tools in their teaching practices.
* **Evaluation and Effectiveness**: Developing robust methods to assess the effectiveness of AI-driven educational tools and their impact on learning outcomes.


## Goals

* **Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration**: To provide a platform for researchers, educators, and industry professionals to share insights, experiences, and best practices regarding the use of generative AI in education. To foster a collaborative environment where participants can engage in discussions, exchange ideas, and form partnerships aimed at advancing the responsible use of AI in education.
* **Exploration of Tools**: To showcase innovative AI tools and applications that can transform educational practices, highlighting both their capabilities and limitations.
* **Risk Mitigation Strategies**: To discuss strategies for identifying and mitigating the risks associated with generative AI, focusing on ethical use, data privacy, and bias reduction. 
* **Policy Recommendations**: To develop guidelines and recommendations for policymakers and educational institutions on the adoption and regulation of generative AI technologies.
* **Future Directions**: To identify emerging trends and future research directions in the field of AI for education, encouraging continued innovation and development.

By addressing these motivations, challenges, and goals, this workshop seeks to contribute significantly to the discourse on generative AI in education, promoting its responsible and effective integration to improve learning outcomes and educational equity.
