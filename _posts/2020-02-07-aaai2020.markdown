## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has dramatically transformed a variety of domains. However, education, a crucial component of our society still remains a relatively under-explored domain. In fact, the increasingly digitalized education tools and the popularity of the massive open online courses have produced an unprecedented amount of data that provides us with invaluable opportunities for applying AI in education. Recent years have witnessed growing efforts from AI research community devoted to advancing our education. Although it is still in the early stage, promising results have been achieved in solving various critical problems in education. For example, knowledge tracing, which is a intrinsically difficult problem due to the complexity under human learning procedure, has been solved successfully with powerful deep neural networks that can fully take the advantages of massive student exercise data. Besides the achievement in improving the student learning efficiency, similar excitement has been generated in other areas of education. For instance, researchers have also devoted to reducing the monotonous and tedious grading workloads of teaching professionals by building automatic grading systems that are underpinned by effective models from natural language process fields. Despite aforementioned success, developing and applying AI technologies to education is fraught with its unique challenges, including, but not limited to, extreme data sparsity, lack of labeled data, and privacy issues. Therefore, it is timely and necessary to provide a venue, which can bring together academia researchers and education practitioners to (1) to discuss the principles, limitations and applications of AI for education; and (2) to foster research on innovative algorithms, novel techniques, and new applications to education.
