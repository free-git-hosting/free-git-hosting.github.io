## What is a Static Website?

### Static vs. Dynamic Websites
Static websites consist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are delivered directly to the user’s browser without any server-side processing. Unlike dynamic websites, they do not use databases or backend languages like PHP.

### Why Choose Static Websites?
- Fast loading times
- More secure (no backend to exploit)
- Easier to host
- Ideal for portfolios, documentation, blogs, and landing pages

## Introduction to GitHub Hosting

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a platform primarily used for version control and collaborative software development. GitHub Pages is a service offered by GitHub that allows users to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository.

### What is GitHub Hosting via GitHub Pages?
GitHub Pages takes the files in a public GitHub repository and publishes them to a website. This means your HTML, CSS, JS, and media files become a live website—at no cost.

### Benefits of GitHub Hosting
- Completely free for public repositories
- Built-in support for Jekyll
- HTTPS support
- Integration with Git for version control
- Custom domain support

## Getting Started with GitHub Hosting

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and register for a free account. You’ll need this to create repositories and use GitHub Pages.

### Step 2: Install Git on Your Computer
While optional, Git makes managing your project files easier. Download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) and follow the installation instructions for your OS.

### Step 3: Set Up Git on Your Local Machine
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

## Creating and Preparing Your Repository

### Step 4: Create a New Repository
- Go to GitHub.
- Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select “New repository.”
- Name the repository in the format `yourusername.github.io`.
- Choose “Public.”
- Initialize with a README (optional).

### Step 5: Add Your Website Files

#### Option A: Upload Files Directly via GitHub
1. Click on "Add file > Upload files"
2. Upload `index.html`, `style.css`, and any JS or image files

#### Option B: Use Git Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io
cd yourusername.github.io
# Add your HTML/CSS/JS files here
```

Commit and push your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add website files"
git push origin main
```

## Enabling GitHub Pages

### Step 6: Configure GitHub Pages
- Go to your repository settings
- Scroll down to the **Pages** section
- Under “Source,” select the `main` branch and root folder `/`
- Click “Save”

GitHub will deploy your website at `https://yourusername.github.io`

### Step 7: Wait for Deployment
It may take a minute or two. Once deployed, visit your new website at the link provided.

## Optional: Using Jekyll with GitHub Pages

### What is Jekyll?
Jekyll is a static site generator that integrates seamlessly with GitHub Pages. It allows you to build blogs and documentation easily using Markdown.

### Step 8: Enable Jekyll Theme
Add a file named `_config.yml` with the following:
```yaml
theme: minima
```
Push the file to your repository. GitHub will rebuild your site using the selected theme.

### Step 9: Use Markdown Files
You can create `.md` files inside the root or `_posts/` folder:
```markdown
---
title: "Welcome"
layout: default
---

This is a sample page.
```

## Customizing Your Website

### Add CSS and JavaScript
Include styles and scripts:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

### Organize Folder Structure
- `/assets` for images and media
- `/css`, `/js` for scripts and stylesheets

## Connecting a Custom Domain

### Step 10: Purchase a Domain
Buy from providers like Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains.

### Step 11: Point Domain to GitHub Pages
- Go to your domain registrar’s DNS settings
- Add a `CNAME` record pointing to `yourusername.github.io`

### Step 12: Add CNAME File in Your Repository
Create a `CNAME` file and add your domain name:
```
www.yourcustomdomain.com
```

GitHub will use this file to redirect the Pages site to your domain.

## Securing Your Site with HTTPS
GitHub Pages supports HTTPS by default. In Settings > Pages, ensure “Enforce HTTPS” is checked.

## Troubleshooting Common Problems

### Site Not Showing?
- Check if `index.html` is present
- Confirm correct branch is selected in Pages settings
- Allow time for DNS propagation if using a custom domain

### Styles Not Loading?
- Make sure paths are relative or start from `/`
- Ensure file extensions are correct

### Deployment Errors?
Check GitHub Pages build logs or switch to a simpler theme/config first.

## Optimizing for SEO

### Use Proper HTML Structure
Start with semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`

### Add Meta Tags
```html
<meta name="description" content="Free static website hosting using GitHub Pages">
```

### Enable Sitemap
Use Jekyll plugins or external tools to generate `sitemap.xml`

### Use Meaningful File Names and URLs
Use short, descriptive paths and titles.

## Analytics and Monitoring

### Add Google Analytics
Sign up at [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com)
Add tracking code inside `<head>`:
```html
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOUR_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'YOUR_ID');
</script>
```

### Alternatives to Google Analytics
- Plausible Analytics
- Fathom Analytics

## Real-World Use Cases

### Developer Portfolios
Perfect for showcasing resumes and project showcases.

### Technical Documentation
Use markdown with Jekyll for readable documentation.

### Static Blogs
Combine Jekyll with markdown to maintain a personal blog.

### Event Pages
Great for creating conference, seminar, or meetup pages.

## Best Practices
