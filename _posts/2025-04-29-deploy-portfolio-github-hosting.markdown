## Step-by-Step: Hosting Portfolio Using GitHub Hosting

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
Sign up at [GitHub.com](https://github.com) if you don’t already have an account.

### Step 2: Install Git
Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com). Configure your Git identity:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

1. Log into GitHub
2. Click "+" > "New repository"
3. Name it: `yourusername.github.io`
4. Set it to Public
5. Initialize with a README (optional)

### Step 4: Add Your Portfolio Files
You can either upload files directly or use Git:

#### Option A: Direct Upload
1. Navigate to your repository
2. Click on "Add file" > "Upload files"

#### Option B: Git Upload
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io
cd yourusername.github.io
# Add all files here
git add .
git commit -m "Add portfolio website"
git push origin main
```

1. Go to repository settings
2. Scroll to **Pages** section
3. Set source branch to `main` and folder to `/`
4. Click **Save**
5. Visit `https://yourusername.github.io` to see your site

### Deployment Time
Deployment takes 1–3 minutes. Refresh the URL after a few moments.

---

## Optional: Use a Template or Jekyll Theme

### Adding a Theme
Create `_config.yml`:
```yaml
theme: minima
```

Add and commit the file. GitHub will rebuild your site using the theme.

### Using Markdown for Content
Create `.md` files for content like blogs or bios:
```markdown
---
title: "About Me"
layout: default
---

I am a passionate frontend developer...
```

---

## Enhancing Your Portfolio

### Add Animations or Interactions
Use JavaScript or libraries like AOS (Animate on Scroll) or GSAP.

### Optimize for Mobile
Use responsive design techniques with CSS media queries.

### Improve Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML tags
- Add `alt` text to images
- Maintain color contrast

---

## Connecting a Custom Domain

### Step 6: Purchase a Domain
Use platforms like Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains.

### Step 7: Add DNS Records
Create a CNAME record pointing to `yourusername.github.io`

### Step 8: Add a CNAME File in Repo
Create a file named `CNAME` and add your domain name:
```
www.yourdomain.com
```

---

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Add Google Analytics
Insert this in your `<head>`:
```html
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOUR_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'YOUR_ID');
</script>
```
