## Introduction

### What Is Web Hosting?
Web hosting refers to a service that allows individuals and businesses to post a website or web page onto the Internet. It typically involves renting server space from a provider.

#### GitHub Hosting
- Requires basic Git and GitHub knowledge
- Best for developers or those learning web development
- Straightforward deployment for static sites via `username.github.io`

#### Traditional Hosting
- Setup often involves cPanel, FTP, or custom dashboards
- Easier for non-developers with drag-and-drop site builders
- Supports both static and dynamic content

### Performance

#### GitHub Hosting
- Serves static content through a global CDN
- Very fast for small, simple sites

#### Traditional Hosting
- Performance varies by provider
- Can handle dynamic content, databases, and complex apps
- Server response may be slower than CDN-based services

### Features and Functionality

#### GitHub Hosting
- Free for public repositories
- Limited to static content (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Jekyll support for blogs and documentation
- Automatic HTTPS and Git integration

#### Traditional Hosting
- Supports server-side languages (PHP, Node.js, Python)
- Database access (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- One-click app installs (WordPress, Joomla)
- Email hosting and domain management

### Custom Domains

#### GitHub Hosting
- Custom domains supported
- Free HTTPS with auto-renewal

#### Traditional Hosting
- Domain registration often included
- Free and paid SSL options depending on plan

---

## Cost Comparison

### GitHub Hosting
- Completely free for public projects

### Traditional Hosting
- Monthly/yearly pricing varies by provider
- May include hidden costs: backups, SSL, support, etc.
- Shared hosting is cheap, but VPS and dedicated servers cost more

## Use Cases: When to Choose What

### Ideal Scenarios for GitHub Hosting

#### Developer Portfolios
Perfect for showcasing code, projects, and resumes.

#### Documentation Sites
Markdown-based documentation is easy to publish with Jekyll.

#### Personal Blogs
Fast and free way to publish simple blog posts.

### Ideal Scenarios for Traditional Hosting

#### Business Websites
E-commerce, marketing, and company sites often need CMS or backend logic.

#### Web Applications
Dynamic content, user authentication, and server-side logic require traditional hosting.

#### WordPress and CMS Sites
GitHub doesn’t support WordPress, which requires PHP and MySQL.
